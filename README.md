# Emoji Expander

You know how in Slack, you can type `:face_with_rolling_eyes:`, and it will give you ðŸ™„? This is a Chrome extension that basically does the opposite of that. When it finds an emoji, it replaces it with its text-based equivilent. 

## Installation

`:warning:` I haven't submitted this to the Chrome Web Store â€” it was just a fun weekend hack!

1. Download this repo.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`
3. Activate "Developer mode" in the top right.
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the "Source" folder you downloaded.
6. Have fun! `:tada:`

## FAQ

_So wait, why did you make this?_

`:shrug:`

_Will this slow down my web experience?_

Yes, probably. Especially if you visit an emoji-heavy page like [this one](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). 

_How do I uninstall it?_

Just select "Remove from Chrome..." like you would for any other extension.
