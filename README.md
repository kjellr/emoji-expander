# Emoji Expander

You know how in Slack, you can type `:face_with_rolling_eyes:`, and it will give you üôÑ? 

This is a Chrome extension that basically does the opposite of that on the webpages you visit. When the extension finds an emoji, it replaces the emoji with the text-based equivilent. 

For example: 

- ‚ù§Ô∏è becomes `:heart:`
- üôÄ becomes `:scream_cat:`
- ü´† becomes `:melting_face:`
- ‚ú® becomes `:sparkles:`
- üï¥Ô∏èbecomes `:man_in_business_suit_levitating:`

Et cetera, you get the picture. Or well... you don't. You get some text instead of the picture. That's the whole point.

## FAQ

_So wait, why did you make this?_

`:shrug:`

_Will this slow down my web experience?_

Yes, probably. Especially if you visit an emoji-heavy page like [this one](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). 

_Does this really replace every single emoji?_

Probably not? It's likely I missed something. Feel free to open an issue if you notice something wrong.

_How do I uninstall it?_

Just select "Remove from Chrome..." like you would for any other extension.
