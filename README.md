# Emoji Expander

You know how in Slack, you can type `:face_with_rolling_eyes:`, and it will give you 🙄? 

This is a Chrome extension that basically does the opposite of that on the webpages you visit. When the extension finds an emoji, it replaces the emoji with the text-based equivilent. 

For example: 

- ❤️ becomes `:heart:`
- 🙀 becomes `:scream_cat:`
- 🫠 becomes `:melting_face:`
- ✨ becomes `:sparkles:`
- 🕴️becomes `:man_in_business_suit_levitating:`

Et cetera, you get the picture. Or well... you don't. You get some text instead of the picture. That's the whole point.

## Installation

## FAQ

> So wait, why did you make this?

`:shrug:` Why not?

> Will this slow down my web experience?

Yes, probably. Especially if you visit an emoji-heavy page like [this one](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). 

> Does this really replace every single emoji?

Probably not? It's likely I missed something. Feel free to open an issue if you notice something wrong.

> How do I uninstall it?

Just select "Remove from Chrome..." like you would for any other extension.
